# @fuzio/contracts

```sh
npm install @fuzio/contracts
yarn add @fuzio/contracts
pnpm install @fuzio/contracts
```

## Fuzio Network TypeScript Bundle

### Clients

All contracts are scoped under the `contracts` object:

```js
import { contracts } from "@fuzio/contracts"
const { FuzioNativePrediction } = contracts
```

Then each contract will have clients, for example for `FuzioNativePrediction`:

```ts
const {
 FuzioNativePredictionClient,
 FuzioNativePredictionMessageComposer,
 FuzioNativePredictionQueryClient
} = FuzioNativePrediction
```
